By definition, “data science” must make meaning out of ever-growing pools of data. But the researcher quickly discovers that the hand examination of any data, while useful for granular analysis, is never adequate for large samples. To produce data science at scale, researchers must make effective use of workflows, pipelines, and processes to ingest, parse, and transform data with tools and automation.

This course will center on exposing students to contemporary pipelines for data analysis through a series of steadily escalating use cases. The course will begin with simple local database construction and evolve to cloud-based infrastructure such as AWS or Google Cloud. This progression will include learning a variety of systems for data collection, orchestration, transformation, consumption, and others as appropriate. We will be exposed to concepts of data wrangling, cleansing, ETL, and some application of Machine Learning, though the focus of this course isn’t to teach that.

## Audience

This course will emphasize hands-on experience in the creation, management, and consumption of various computational services that support the practice of data science. For the purposes of getting started, I will assume that you fit roughly into at least one of three categories as you approach the subject:

1. **Data Scientist / Researcher**  
2. **Developer / CS**  
3. **Data Engineer / Systems**  
4. **Other** – you are just stepping into this space and want to apply this to your major

Students will learn how to implement data science systems according to best practices, with an emphasis on creating reusable and portable environments.

## Grading

| **Component**                       | **Weight** | **Notes / Due**                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------|-----------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Student Survey**                 | *(N/A)*    | First week of class                                                                                      |
| **Lectures, readings, other material** | *(N/A)* | Weekly before class discussion                                                                           |
| **Homework**                       | 30%        | Typically, weekly based on reading and discussions                                                       |
| **Class Participation/Labs**       | 20%        | Measured through various methods; assigned on Wed, with in-class time to complete                         |
| **Data Projects**                  | 50%        | Two data projects across the semester (no final exam)                                                    |

- **Student Survey** – a simple questionnaire for me to ascertain baseline skills for the class and students’ familiarity with various tools and concepts.  
- **Lectures / Reading / Viewing** – Will be posted beforehand. Though not a graded portion of the course, these materials are carefully selected to introduce and explain important concepts. If you skip them, you will likely not perform well in the course.  
- **Labs** – an important way for you to interact with tools, code, and get hands-on experience. These will typically be posted at least a week ahead; you will have Wednesday class time to work on them and should submit by Friday of that week.  
- **Class Participation** – includes interaction in class, extra writing, and group/peer review. Collaboration is an important part of functioning well in data science.  
- **Data Projects** – graded assignments that assess your understanding of course material. Projects will be posted one week before the due date.

## Office Hours

**M/W**  
My job is to serve you. I want to make myself as available as possible. While I’ll post standard office hours, you can always DM me to schedule time outside those windows. We have a diverse set of students with varying degrees of technical skills, so I’m happy to help however needed. You’re also welcome to discuss career ideas, interview tips, or anything else.

---

## Tools

You will be expected to use the following software weekly:

- **Git/GitHub** – Students must know how to version control their material using Git. Some programming assignments will require submission via commits pushed to GitHub. If you need a tutorial, please let me know.  
- **Databases** – We will use locally installed instances of MySQL, SQLite, and others. A server-based MySQL instance will be provided if you prefer not to install locally. As we progress, we will move to a cloud-based version as well.  
- **Python 3.12** – We will primarily code in Python 3.12, using Anaconda Navigator for IDE and environment management. If you prefer another IDE, that’s fine, but let’s all stick to Python 3.12 to avoid version conflicts.

## Policies

### Honor Policy

The course will be conducted according to the UVA honor system. Programming assignments and exams are to be completed individually (no group collaborations). You will sign an honor pledge for all assignments, quizzes, and exams. More importantly, I expect you to adhere to the *intent* of the pledge. Cooperative efforts at understanding the material and technologies of the course are encouraged, but final code must be your own.

All suspected violations will be forwarded to the Honor Committee, and you may, at my discretion, receive an immediate zero on that assignment regardless of any action taken by the Committee.

If you believe you may have committed an Honor Offense, consider filing a Conscientious Retraction by calling the Honor Offices at (434) 924-7602 before you become aware that your action is under suspicion by anyone. More info can be found at [http://honor.virginia.edu](http://honor.virginia.edu). Your Honor representatives can be found at [http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives](http://honor.virginia.edu/representatives).

### Disabilities or Learning Needs

It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options.

Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options for removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. Please visit [sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu](https://sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu/) for info. If you have already been approved for accommodations, send me your accommodation letter, and we’ll make an implementation plan together.

All lectures and learning material will remain available online. If you need more time for assignments, per SDAC accommodations, contact me.

### Discrimination and Power-Based Violence

UVA is dedicated to providing a safe, equitable learning environment for all. Two crucial values:

1. Power-based personal violence is never acceptable.  
2. Everyone has a responsibility to maintain a safe community on Grounds.

If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, info is available at [www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence).  

As a faculty member, I’m a “responsible employee” and must report to the Title IX Coordinator if I learn of such an incident. If you wish to report something you’ve seen or experienced, you can do so at [http://justreportit.virginia.edu/](http://justreportit.virginia.edu/).

---

### Religious Accommodations

It is UVA policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so they do not experience adverse academic consequences when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

If you need accommodation for religious observance, please request it in writing, as far in advance as possible. Questions about religious accommodations can be directed to [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200.

### Preservation of Classroom Discussions

I will preserve weekly class discussions in Discord for the duration of the semester. Since these discussions include fellow students, you and they may be personally identifiable in these logs. These logs are only for course study with others enrolled this semester. You may not distribute them in whole or in part through any other platform unless you have written permission from me and have informed all participants.

---

## Other Details

- **Readings & Lectures**: Students are expected to complete every reading and watch every lecture. Gaps in your understanding will affect performance on assignments and exams.
- **Deadlines & Timing**: Start assignments early. Software/hardware can fail, or websites might be temporarily down. Keep to the posted schedule for readings, lectures, and due dates.

---

## Support or Contact

If you have questions about course topics, tools, or anything else, contact me or the TAs on Discord or via email. For Python environment issues, we’ll be using Python 3.12 with Anaconda Navigator. Feel free to use another IDE if you prefer, but do maintain version consistency.
